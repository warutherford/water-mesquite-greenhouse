# Abstract

## Aim
We sought to identify the functional traits important for initial establishment of a globally invasive shrub, _Prosopis_ spp., by quantifying morphological and ecophysiological responses of seedlings to contrasting moisture regimes. Our model plant was _Prosopis velutina_ (Woot.), a prominent invader of North American grasslands. 

## Methods
Seedlings received one of three watering levels corresponding to regional ambient (100%), dry (-65%; reduction of 65% relative to ambient), and wet (+165%; increase of 65% relative to ambient) growing season precipitation regimes. A total of 32 plant aboveground, belowground, and ecophysiological traits were assessed when seedlings reached ages of 11- and 22-days. 

## Results
Germination under dry conditions was high (72%) and only slightly reduced compared to ambient and wet conditions with subsequent seedling survival unaffected. High trait plasticity supported early recruitment over the range of soil moisture conditions, including extreme drought. Fresh weight, absolute growth rate, tap root length, and root surface area and mass were the key traits in distinguishing between responses to altered moisture regimes.

## Conclusions
Shrub seedling establishment in drylands characterized by low and variable rainfall is contingent on the ability to exploit short-term windows of soil moisture availability. Dry conditions reduced germination and slowed seedling growth but did not prevent early establishment. Our results do not support the widely held assumption that the initial recruitment of dryland shrubs is episodic with respect to above-average rainfall. Indeed, early recruitment of _P. velutina_ and functionally similar species can potentially occur even in moisture conditions well below-average. Recognition of this potential should be factored into grassland conservation, management, and monitoring planning.
